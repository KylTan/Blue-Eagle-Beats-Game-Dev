PlayerFriend: Huh..huh.. that was tiring, but great! The hype was through the roof!
PlayerCharacter: Yeah!! You can say that again!! I'm honestly pretty tired already though.
PlayerFriend: You finally loosened up, it was great wasn't it?
PlayerFriend: Maybe you're starting to believe in yourself like those animeâ€”
PlayerCharacter: Ok let's stop right there bud...

PlayerCharacter: Before I forget, I have to [u]maintain[/u] the bass. All that playing must've loosened it up quite a bit.
PlayerFriend: Oh yeah. Make sure you properly adjust all the rods based on what the [u]Equipment Lead[/u] said. You remembered to bring your [u]Rachet[/u] right?
PlayerCharacter: Yeah will do... Now where did I put that thing?
