PlayerFriend: Huh..huh.. that was tiring but great! The hype was through the roof!
PlayerCharacter: Yeah!! You can say that again!! It felt great but I feel so tired already..
PlayerFriend: You finally loosened up, it was great wasn't it?
PlayerFriend: Maybe you're starting to believe in yourself like those animeâ€”
PlayerCharacter: Ok whatever you say bud...
...
PlayerCharacter: Before I forget, I have to [u]maintain[/u] the bass. All that playing must've loosened it up quite a bit.
PlayerFriend: Oh yeah. Make sure you properly adjust all the rods based on what the Equipment Lead said. You remembered to bring your [u]Rachet[/u] right?
PlayerCharacter: Yeah will do... Now where did I put that thing?

Placeholder: (For this minigame, you will be the adjusting the rods, or screws, to a specific degree. Too much, or too little, and it won't end well for your drum.)
Placeholder: (Click on a rod, and use your mouse to spin the rachet tool by the correct amount shown by the progress meter. You can only move on once you've adjusted each rod by the correct amount!)
PlayerCharacter: (I better get started before the next half starts then.)
