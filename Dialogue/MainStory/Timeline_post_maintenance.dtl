Tryout_Manager: Some of these drums are older than your parents, so make sure to treat them with the most care!
Tryout_Manager: Before we formally end, the first basketball game of the season will come up eventually down the road. Hopefully all of you will be trained and prepared by then, so for now we expect you all to keep up.
